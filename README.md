1. Phishing, baiting, and tailgating are examples of ________ attacks.
:-social engineering
(Yep! These three attack types are designed to trick or deceive people into trusting an attacker. Phishing 

accomplishes this via email, baiting uses physical props like USB drives, and tailgating happens when the 

attacker follows you into a restricted area.)


2. When cleaning up a system after a compromise, you should look closely for any ______ that may have 

been installed by the attacker.
:-Backdoors
(Wohoo! Attackers commonly install backdoors in systems that they compromise to maintain access to the 

system even after the vulnerability they exploited originally gets patched.)

3. A(n) _____ attack is meant to prevent legitimate traffic from reaching a service.
:-Denial of Service
(
Yes! A DoS, or denial-of-service, attack is meant to prevent legitimate traffic from reaching a service.)

4. The best defense against password attacks is using strong _______.
:-Passwords
(Great job! Strong passwords will make password attacks too time-consuming to be viable for an attacker.)


5. The practice of tricking someone into providing information they shouldn't is called ________.
:-Social Engineering
(Yes! Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people to get them to do things or divulge 

information that they shouldn't.)

6. What could potentially decrease the availability of security and also test the preparedness of data loss?
:-Ransomware
(Great work! Ransomware could prevent access to your data by holding the data hostage until you pay a 

ransom.)

7. What's the difference between a virus and a worm?
:-Viruses replicate through files, but worms live on their own.
(Woohoo! Viruses and worms are similar. The difference is that a virus spreads through files and worms 

don't need to attach to something to spread.)

A hacker infected your computer to steal your Internet connection and used your machine's resources to 

8. mine Bitcoin. What is the name of this kind of attack?
:-A bot
(You nailed it! Malware can use a victim's machine to perform a task controlled by a hacker. At that point, 

the compromised machine is known as a bot.)

A hacker stood outside a building and spun up a wireless network without anyone's knowledge. At that 

point, the hacker was able to gain unauthorized access to a secure corporate network. Which of these is the 

9. name of this type of attack?
:-A Rogue AP(Access Point) Attack
(Nice job! A Rogue AP is an access point that is installed on the network without the network admin's 

knowledge. This is very dangerous because this can allow a hacker to gain unauthorized access to a 

secure network.)

Which of these is where a victim connects to a network that the victim thinks is legitimate, but is really an 

10. identical network controlled by a hacker to monitor traffic?
:-__________

11. How can injection attacks be prevented? Check all that apply.
:-Data sanitization
:-Input Validation


12. Which of these is a way to help prevent brute-force attacks? Check all that apply.
:-Captchas
:-Strong Passwords

13. An end-user received an email stating his bank account was compromised, and that he needs to click a link 
to reset his password. When the user visited the site, he recognized it as legitimate and entered his 
credentials which were captured by a hacker. What type of social engineering attack does this describe?
:-A Phishing attack
